# Order summary card

![Design preview for the Order summary card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Feel free to use google.com for reference.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

You will find all the required things in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
